# GeneratePassphrase
You can use this program to generate various types of passphrase  
So, there are basically four types of passphrase that you can create

1. Alphabetical (contains only alphabets) 
2. Numeric (contains only numbers) 
3. Special (contains only special characters)
4. Mixed (contains all of the above) 

You have to choose what type of passphrase you want

You can set the length of the passphrase to be between 8-16

Once you choose the type and set the length, your passphrase will be generated accordingly 

And voila your passphrase is been created
